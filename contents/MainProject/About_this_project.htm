  <p>This topic appears at the top of most of the different Tables of Contents used. It is here to describe what the narrative is behind this RoboHelp project.</p>
  <p>This <span data-keyref="Company_Name">Learn A Latte</span> project included with Adobe RoboHelp is based upon a fictional, yet hopefully plausible, business/school situation.</p>
  <p>The situation is a combination of an operational coffee shop that also functions as a barista training school.</p>
  <p>This situation should provide an opportunity to demonstrate using the single sourcing capabilities of Adobe RoboHelp to supply information intended for different audiences. For example, an output may be generated that contains information that is intended
    to be consumed by potential customers consisting of your typical coffee shop clients as well as potential new students that would sign up for the Barista school. In this case, RoboHelp may be used to generate an output consisting of only files that
    would be of interest to this audience and uploaded to a web server reachable by the outside world.</p>
  <p>In another example, perhaps information that may only be of interest to employees or actual students of the shop or school would be generated and copied to an intranet server, where only those authorized folks have access to the information.</p>

  <p>This folder exists over in the Main Project folders and stores all the Captivate HTML 5 output files. There are two different Captivate projects used in this sample. One is for the Splash Banner as seen on many web sites where five images are presented
    in a slide show fashion. The second is a quiz to evaluate whether someone has the traits that would make for a good barista. Each folder contains a collection of files and more folders that are related to the Captivate HTML 5 output.</p>
  <p>Note that the opening page presented when you generate some of the outputs loads up the <a href="../../MainProject/Splash.htm">Splash</a> page. And that page has a META redirect in the HTML code that points to the Captivate created banner.)</p>
  <p>The second Captivate project containing the quiz appears inside an Inline Frane. The Inline Frame is configured to point to the Index.html of the Captivate output files.</p>
  <p>Check out the Inline Frame and Captivate information in the <span data-keyref="Other_Sample_Name">RoboHelp Reimagined</span> project.</p>

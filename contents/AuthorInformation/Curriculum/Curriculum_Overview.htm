 Curriculum Overview Topic</h1>
<p><a href="../../MainProject/Curriculum/Curriculum_Overview.htm">Click 
 here</a> to view the live topic described by this topic.</p>
<p>As the project is about a barista school, it seems only natural that 
 a curriculum should be presented. This topic outlines the six week process.</p>
<p>Each bullet point is also a Dynamic HTML (DHTML) drop-down that may 
 be clicked to reveal hidden information. Within each of the hidden areas 
 is a hyperlink pointing to the About topic that outlines the agenda for 
 each of the weeks.</p>
<p>Because the same overview information is actually used in two different 
 topics, the information has been inserted into a Snippet and the Snippet 
 added to each of the two topics.</p>
<p>The topic also uses the links feature and the bullets feature of RoboHelp. 
 </p>
<p>Open  the <span data-keyref="Other_Sample_Name">RoboHelp Reimagined</span> 
 project for more information on creating links, applying bullets, using 
 snippets and Dynamic HTML Drop-Downs.</p>

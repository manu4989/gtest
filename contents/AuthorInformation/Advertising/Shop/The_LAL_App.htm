<p>The LAL App topic is referring to a totally fictional app that has been 
 developed for <span data-keyref="Company_Name">Learn A Latte</span>. 
 The main image of the phone is one that has been included with RoboHelp 
 for the last few versions. It was modified using TechSmith SnagIt so it 
 appears to be presenting an app on a mobile phone.</p>

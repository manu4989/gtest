 Tagging and Filtering</h1>
<p>One of the most useful aspects of Adobe RoboHelp is the ability to use 
 something known as Condition Tags. These allow the RoboHelp author to 
 define tags and apply them to content so that information may be used 
 in different ways.</p>
<p>The basic use of Condition Tags is to control what content ends up in 
 the output. For example, perhaps this project should be output as a customer, 
 or a potential student should see it. In this case, certain information 
 such as this author information should be omitted when the output is created. 
 And to do this, all topics containing information only intended for the 
 RoboHelp author have been tagged. When output is generated, a condition 
 expression is used that results in removing or &quot;leaving behind&#39; information 
 that is not intended to be included in the output.</p>

  <h1>The Splash Topic</h1>
  <p><a href="../MainProject/Splash.htm">Click here</a> to view the live topic described by this topic.</p>
  <p>When a RoboHelp output is created, there is one topic that is nominated to be the &quot;Default Topic&quot;. This is the first topic presented to the viewer when the system loads up.</p>
  <p>In this project the topic is named &quot;Splash&quot;.</p>
  <p>Essentially this topic contains a META redirect code in the HTML that points to the start page for one of the Captivate outputs. In order to see the redirect, look at the HTML code of the Splash.htm topic. This also serves to demonstrate one possibility
    of what can be created using Adobe Captivate and combined with Adobe RoboHelp.</p>

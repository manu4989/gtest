 Organization</h1>
<p>This project contains two different main folders that have mirroring 
 structures. </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>AuthorInformation</li>
	<li>MainProject</li>
</ul>
<p>The thought here is that the MainProject structure will contain the 
 actual final project that can simply be opened and used to rapidly and 
 easily create output. </p>
<p>The AuthorInformation structure will contain topics that provide information 
 on the features that have been used in each of the respective topics as 
 well as pointers of where to find the feature in the <span data-keyref="Other_Sample_Name">RoboHelp Reimagined</span> 
 project. That way it should be fairly simple to learn how to implement 
 that feature in your own projects. Where possible, references to the other 
 sample project will be included so that you may learn more about the feature.</p>

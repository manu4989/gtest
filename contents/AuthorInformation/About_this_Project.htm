  <p>With all versions of RoboHelp, there are typically sample projects that are included and ship with the product. These sample projects are included in an effort to provide examples of how projects actually look and behave without going through the process
    of actually creating a project and adding content.</p>
  <p><video src="../assets/media/Applause.mp3" width="270" height="152" controls=""></video></p>
  <p>This particular project is named <span data-keyref="Company_Name">Learn A Latte</span> and is centered around a fictitious barista school using the same name. We are assuming the school operates as a live and functional coffee shop as well as a training
    facility for new baristas.</p>
  <p>The other sample project is named <span data-keyref="Other_Sample_Name">RoboHelp Reimagined</span> and it details how most of the functions in RoboHelp 2019 work. </p>
  <p>Throughout this project you will see an icon appearing in the upper right corner of each of the main topics. Clicking this icon should display an Author Information topic that describes what the features that have been used are, as well as where to
    find them in the other sample project.</p>
